# Phaser-Framework-Based-Games
Contains light-weight and enjoyable indie games built using Phaser Framework.

Hey there,

This repository as the name suggests contains games built using **Phaser**. 
So, I wanted to make lightweight indie games and I found about Phaser and a [tutorial](https://academy.zenva.com/product/the-complete-mobile-game-development-course-platinum-edition/)  based on it from ZENVA by Pablo Farias Navarro.
Some of the projects in this repo are inspired from the tutorial and are re-skinned.

**What is Phaser?**

  Phaser is a fast, free and fun open source framework for Canvas and WebGL powered browser games. [More Info can be found here.](https://phaser.io/)
